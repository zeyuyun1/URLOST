## Overview

We introduce a novel framework that learns from high-dimensional data without prior knowledge of its stationarity and topology. Our model, dubbed URLOST, combines a learnable self-organizing layer, density-adjusted spectral clustering, and masked autoencoders. We evaluate its effectiveness on three diverse data modalities including simulated biological vision, neural recordings from the primary visual cortex, and gene expressions. Compared to state-of-the-art unsupervised learning methods like SimCLR and MAE, our model excels at learning meaningful representations across diverse modalities without knowing their stationarity or topology. It also outperforms other methods not dependent on these factors, setting a new benchmark in the field. We position this work as a step toward unsupervised learning methods capable of generalizing across diverse high-dimensional data modalities.
